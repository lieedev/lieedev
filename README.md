👋 Hi, I'm Lieee

Hello I'm Firli Herdiansyah, usually called Lieee, a vocational high school graduate majoring in Software Engineering who is currently preparing for undergraduate studies while building a strong foundation in information technology and secure system development.

My main interests include information systems, secure software development, digital security concepts, and the responsible use of technology for public benefit and education. During my time after graduation, I focus on strengthening my academic fundamentals, improving logical and analytical thinking skills, preparing for the national university entrance examination (UTBK/SNBT), and developing small educational IT projects that comply with legal and ethical standards. Through my projects, I aim to apply secure and responsible software development practices, with all work created solely for learning and educational purposes. My long-term goal is to pursue higher education in Information Systems or Informatics and contribute to the development of secure, reliable, and socially beneficial technologies.
